An Organizer App for iOS devices where you can add different tasks and schedule a notification that reminds you of them.

I experimented with Pods in Xcode with Swift and added a custom Calendar in this app, because the native Calendar can't be used in third-party iOS apps.

You'll need to install CocoaPods (search on Google) and use the FSCalendar framework to display the Calendar.
